# 📊 Superstore Sales Analysis Summary

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Identify profitable and underperforming product categories and sub-categories.**
2. **Analyze sales and profit trends across different states and regions.**
3. **Understand the impact of discounts on profit margins.**
4. **Evaluate customer segments and their purchasing behaviors.**
5. **Assess shipping modes and their relation to delivery time and profitability.**


## 🔍 Key Analyses Performed

* **Sales vs. Profit Analysis**
  Identified which product categories bring in high sales but low profit (e.g., *Technology vs. Office Supplies*).

* **Regional Performance**
  Mapped profits by state and region — revealing that the *West* and *East* regions tend to be more profitable than the *Central* region.

* **Discount Impact**
  Found a negative correlation between high discounts and profits — heavy discounts often resulted in losses.

* **Segment-wise Sales Breakdown**
  Discovered that *Corporate* and *Consumer* segments generate the majority of revenue, but *Home Office* sometimes yields higher profit margins.

* **Shipping Mode Efficiency**
  Found that *Standard Class* is most used, but *Same Day* delivery, although rare, has higher profitability per order.


## 📈 Insights

* Products in the **Technology** category are high in sales **but vulnerable to profit loss** when discounted.
* The **South region** consistently underperforms in profitability despite moderate sales.
* **Frequent high discounts** are not a reliable strategy for increasing profits — especially in the *Furniture* category.
* **Top states** like California and New York dominate both sales and profit.
* Certain **sub-categories like Binders and Phones** drive revenue but need pricing and discount strategy review.
